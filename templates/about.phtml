            <h4>Query inspector</h4>
            <p>At the top of every page you will see a little "Queries" box. Clicking it will reveal a queries pane. This pane captures all the SQL queries used to generate a specific page. Most of our queries and all of our queries needed for grading are visible this way. There is also a handy way to reset the database through the query inspector. The following queries are excluded from the inspector:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Integrity checking on the main page with <code>SHOW TABLES</code></li>
                <li><code>INSERT</code> command for reviews (is lost in redirect chain)</li>
                <li>SQL scripts for database resetting</li>
            </ul>
